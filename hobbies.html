    <h3>Plyaing U frisbee</h3>
    <p>I enjoy playing this sport because it is a healthy outlet for emotions and a good way to be a part of something bigger. I am one of the captains of the A team and the whole club. this allows me to teach and learn from the best and expand my experiences as someone in this community.</p>

  <div class="hobby">
    <h3>Playing Musical Instruments</h3>
    <p>I love to play the guitar because it is a way to share my emotions with others other than talking. I am all self-taught in the Instrument and am proud of that. it is a good way of distracting myself and using my time to create something. I have made multiple different songs while learning to play and have a long way to go.</p>
